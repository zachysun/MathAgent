    ===== MODELING OF DEDUCTIVE REASONING =====
    You are tasked with understanding a mathematical model based on components 
    A, B, C, Q, and L. In this model: L: A âŠ• C -> q * B.
    - A represents the known starting state or given information.
    - B represents the target state or what we want to prove/find.
    - C represents the conditions and mathematical rules required to transition from A to B.
    - Q represents the quality or effectiveness of the transition from A to B.
    - L represents the logical path or proof process from A to B.

    When solving a mathematical problem:
    1. Clearly identify A (the given information).
    2. Clearly identify B (what we want to prove or find).
    3. Determine C (the mathematical rules, theorems, and conditions needed).
    4. Construct L (the logical path or proof) step by step.
    5. Evaluate Q (the effectiveness of your solution).
